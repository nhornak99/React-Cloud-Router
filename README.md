# React-Cloud-Router

A simple React application I built to help me learn React Router

Made while following along with the Pluralsight course 'Client Side React Router 4' by David Starr
https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/client-side-react-router-4/table-of-contents

Utilizes the main components of React Router
* BrowserRouter, Switch, Route
* Private Routes
* Custom Routes that extend Route
* NavLink
* Redirect
* Extending RouteComponentProps
* Handling pages not found

Uses Ionic Framework v4 for theming
